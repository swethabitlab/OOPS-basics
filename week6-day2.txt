Types of variables:
 depends on the place and usage variables can be divided into three types;
1.Local variables
2.Instance variables
3.Static variables

1.Local Variables: The variables that are created inside any method or block or constructor.
*When control comes out of block or method or constructor the local variables will be destroyed.
*When we using local variables we need to initialize the variables with some value.
*Local variables can't be defined with static keyword
*Local variable will be stored inside the "stock area"
*for temporary purpose of execution of methods we can use local variables

2.Instance variables:Instance variable have seperate  values for object to object
*It can be declared outside of any method or block or constructor but within the class
*seperate copy of variables will be created as part os the object inside the heap memory
*JVM will provide default values
*Instance variables stored in the heap memory

3.Static variables:Static variable have similar  values for object to object
*It can be declared outside of any method or block or constructor but within the class
*only one copy of variables will be created as part os the object inside the heap memory
*JVM will provide default values
*Static variables stored in the "method area/class area".

Types of Methods:
*Mutator methods/setter methods/setters:Methods which are used to set/modify the data of objects is called setters.
*Accessor methods/getter methods/getters:Methods which are used to get/access data fom objects is called getters.

Method Overloading:
  In java,two or more methods have same name but they differ in parameters(no.of parameters,datatype of parameters)
these methods are called overloaded methods and this feature is called as "Method overloading".
Method overloading can be achieved by either:
*changing the number of parameters or
*changing the datatype of parameters
 If we only change the return type,then it cannot be called as method overloading.

Constructors:
*The purpose of constructor is to create the objects of the class and initialize values for the Instance variables.
*Constructor is similar to method,but the difference between constructors and methods are;
 1.constructor name and class name must be match where as in methods we can use any name,
 2.constructor don't return any value where as method return some type of value.
